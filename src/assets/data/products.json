The Gorilla® Glass 3 protects the blue sub-second dial and gold-plated Swiss movement with its high resistance to scratches and sharp content damage. The rich brown leather strap is made with American hides by American craftsmen.

An inlaid magnetic closure and brass hinges secure the felt-lined custom setting for the rare occasions when the watch is not being worn.

        "description": "Our iconic 1960s Marlin® case gets an aesthetic refresh. Ticking inside is a tried and true 21 jewel automatic movement, creating a contemporary timepiece that honors our watchmaking history. Powered by your motion, the movement has a 40-hour power reserve and can also be wound with the crown. The sleek monochromatic design is given a playful update with Snoopy and Woodstock on the dial. True to our original Marlin®, the stainless-steel case and silver-tone dial are complemented by a classic black natural leather strap and its iconic domed acrylic crystal.",
